YOLO-NAS delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the unparalleled accuracy-speed performance, outperforming other models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8.

Training with SuperGradients,  PyTorch-based computer vision library. SuperGradients is fully compatible with PyTorch Datasets and Dataloaders, so you can use your dataloaders as is.

In this video, we demonstrate how to implement Object Detection using YOLOv-NAS and Python, specifically for Detecting under the sea images
<br/><br/> 
What you'll learn:

- How to import and utilize the Yolo-Nas model .
- How to train Yolo-Nas model with a custom under the sea dataset.
- How to make predictions and draw bounding boxes around detected teeth.
