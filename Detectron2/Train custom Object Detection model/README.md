Want to train your own object detection model? In this video, you'll learn how to use Detectron2, a powerful deep learning framework, to build a custom object detector in Python. We'll walk you through the entire process, from setting up your dataset and training your model to making predictions on new images.

Even if you're new to deep learning, this beginner-friendly tutorial will guide you step-by-step. Here's what you'll learn:


* Installing and setting up Detectron2
* Preparing your custom object detection dataset (annotations & images)
* Training your model with Detectron2 (including configuration options)
* Using your trained model for object detection on new images
* Visualizing the results with bounding boxes and class labels
