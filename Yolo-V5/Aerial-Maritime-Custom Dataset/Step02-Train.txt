1. Goto the Yolo5 main folder 

2. Start the train : 

# --data -> update full path for the data.ymal file
# --name -> update full path for the results
# -- epochs -> 250 
3. run this from c:/cool-Python-stuff/yolov5 

# run it with the meduim model
python train.py --data C:/Data-Sets/Aerial-Maritime/data.yaml --weights yolov5m.pt --img 640 --epochs 250 --batch-size 16 --name C:/Data-Sets/Aerial-Maritime/All-results

4. look at the values of box_loss obj_loss -> is should be decreasing . Map sould go up -> this is the quality

5. There are two result : Last.pt and best.pt . Best.pt is the best model

6. After the train finish , look at the P (precision ) of each object -> you can see which class will be better in prediction
