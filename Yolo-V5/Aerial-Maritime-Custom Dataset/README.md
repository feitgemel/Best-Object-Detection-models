YOLOv5 is the evolution in the YOLO family of object detection models. It's the first YOLO implementation native to PyTorch (rather than Darknet) and emphasizes ease of use and quickness of training and inference.  This YOLOv5 tutorial shows you how to train the model on your own dataset in Python.

You will also learn how to install YoloV5 , Download a custom dataset , discover the data and the class , Train an object detection model based on YoloV5 and test the result on a new and fresh image
