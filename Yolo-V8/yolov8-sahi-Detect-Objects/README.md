Welcome to our tutorial on integrating the SAHI (Slicing Aided Hyper Inference) library with YOLOv8 for enhanced object detection and instance segmentation! In this video, we'll guide you through the entire process, from installation to implementation, ensuring you can leverage the power of SAHI to improve your object detection projects.
<br/><br/> 
What you'll learn:

- Overview of the SAHI library and its key features.
- Installing SAHI and YOLOv8.
- Running Predictions , Performing sliced and standard predictions using YOLOv8 with SAHI
- Visualizing Results !!
