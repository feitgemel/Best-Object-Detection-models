In this video, we demonstrate how to implement Object Detection using YOLOv8 and Python, specifically for Detecting playing cards. 
Follow along as we load a trained YOLO model, process images, and visualize both predictions and ground truth annotations.
<br/><br/> 
What you'll learn:

How to import and utilize the YOLOv8 model from the ultralytics library.
How to load and interpret annotation data from a YAML file.
How to train your YOLOv8 model with a custom teeth dataset.
How to make predictions and draw bounding boxes around detected teeth.
