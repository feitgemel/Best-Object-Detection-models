In this tutorial, we delve into the world of **computer vision** by creating a **YOLOv8-based dogs breed object detection ** using **Deep learning **. 
<br/><br/> 
What you'll learn:

How to import and utilize the YOLOv8 model from the Ultralytics library.
How to convert annotations from XML format to Yolo format
How to load and interpret annotation data from a YAML file.
How to train your YOLOv8 model with a dogs dataset.
How to make predictions and draw bounding boxes around detected dogs.
